# Argus
Argus is a custom-built framework that can autonomously monitor a domain's subdomains and alert the user to any detected changes. While you are welcome to use this project, it does not have any documentation yet and probably won't have any proper documentation for the forseeable future, so you're on your own for figuring out how it works ;)

for questions etc you can reach out to me on discord (._Lars)

# Unstable
All versions of Argus should be considered unstable/experimental. Argus is in early development and I have not bothered to implement proper testing yet (I know I should, I just haven't really gotten around to it). This means that any version of Argus might have issues, ranging from minor problems to making the framework unusable.

If you run into any such issue you can contact me on discord (again, ._Lars), or if you're feeling adventurous you can try to fix it yourself ;)
