# Argus
Argus is a custom-built framework that can autonomously monitor a domain's subdomains and alert the user to any detected changes. While you are welcome to use this project, it does not have any documentation yet and probably won't have any proper documentation for the forseeable future, so you're on your own for figuring out how it works ;)

for questions etc you can reach out to me on discord (._Lars)
